So I want to implement some type of a stream manager.

The goal of this solution is to solve the problem of
streaming live audio to subscribers, this should
handle more than 5K concurrent users.

The first iteration of this project was implemented
using a twisted protocol (RTMP).

I ended up using Nginx server using RTMP protocol and then
activate HLS to stream using a browser plugin (because flash sucks, fuck you adobe).

No need to edit the nginx config on the fly and send signals to it
just do the login in the application level.

* TODO [#A] Implement some type of authentication.
* TODO [#B] Implement an interface to display beautiful graphs and some stats.
* TODO [#A] Implement feature to create room + register to admin.
