So I want to implement some type of a stream manager.

The goal of this solution is to solve the problem of
streaming live audio to subscribers, this should
handle more than 5K concurrent users.

The first iteration of this project was implemented
using a twisted protocol (RTMP).

I ended up using Nginx server using RTMP protocol and then
activate HLS to stream using a browser plugin (because flash sucks, fuck you adobe).

* TODO Implement some type of authentication.
* TODO Implement an interface to display beautiful graphs and some stats.
* TODO Implement some type of interface to interfere with the nginx config to allow me the operator to create other configurations.
